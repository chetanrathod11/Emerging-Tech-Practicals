ðŸ“˜ README â€“ Big Data Analysis Practicals
Author:CHETAN SANTOSH RATHOD

This repository contains practical experiments in Big Data Analysis, Statistical Methods, and Machine Learning, implemented using Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and WEKA Tool.

ðŸ§ª Practical List:
Exp_1: Unique & Duplicate Value Count

Exp_2: Normal Distribution Analysis

Exp_3: Naive Bayes, Confusion Matrix, K-Fold

Exp_4: Z-Test

Exp_5: T-Test

Exp_6: ANOVA Test

Exp_7: Logistic Regression

Exp_8: Linear Regression

Exp_9: WEKA Tool Analysis â€“ ML implementation using GUI

Exp_10: Correlation Matrix Analysis

Exp_11: Confusion Matrix Analysis

ðŸš€ How to Run:
Open .ipynb files in VS Code with the Jupyter extension

Install libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run each notebook cell-by-cell for output

For Exp_9, use WEKA Tool to perform model training and evaluation
